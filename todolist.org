* general

** TODO use the todolist

* bugfixes/improvements
  
** TODO break reaction 
   broken pnet : only one piece is added, and pnet is not removed
   -> does it still happen

** TODO sanitize the use mutable/immutable structures
   - [ ] in amolset
   - [ ] everywhere ?

** TODO mol quantity go under 0
** TODO sandbox pnet id
   when requesting pnet_from_mol, pnet_id is sometimes missing

** DONE reporter service
   - [X] log folder
   - [ ] better logs
   - [X] use logs as a backend for reporter
   - [X] cli reporter works
** DONE revert amolset to a simpler state
   we will modify ARMgr to be a wrapper over 
   PnetSet.t Map, and same thing with IRMgr

   Pour rendre les choses propres, toute action 
   qui modifie un état interne renvoie la liste
   des actions à effectuer à plus haut niveau

** DONE petri net display inconsistencies
   the first time display works, but the next ones fail
   -> the problem was with cytoscape : empty_filter was not rcognised 
   and caused a bug

** DONE change « send to bact » to « send to sandbox » 
   in the molbuilder tab, and change behaviour accordingly

** DONE reactions initialisation seems broken :
   grabs happen between the same pnet (same id), and are added six times !
   -> problem solved, there was an error whan adding reactions to IRMap
* architecture
** CURRENT implement tests
   describe bacteria where only one kind of reaction can happen to
   be able to predict results

** TODO sanitize server files :
   - use dune to copy files to the build directory
   - put external libs in an archive to clean git repo
** DONE split the web client in multiple pages

** DONE global reaction coefficient (in environment) : 
   The idea is to put these parameters in an environment module,
   that could be subject to dynamic changes. This would also allow 
   changes set by user input.
   There still lies the tradeoff between having reactions use this
   coefficient directly, or using it later in reac_mgr.
   A better abstraction in reac_mgr would allow to avoid too much boilerplate.

   - [X] feature
   - [X] interface to modify coefficients dynamically
     (is it possible ?)
   - [X] web interface

** DONE switch to a rest API for the webserver


* features

** TODO random binds
   - [ ] clean feature/random-binds branch
   - [ ] finalise feature

** TODO extended pnets (as graphs)



* optional

** TODO swith to ocsigen (or opium ?) for the web client/server (will never happen)

** TODO simple reactions to test against

* org mode cheat sheet

** checklist :
 - [X] switch with C-c C-c
 - [ ]  

** STATES

*** TODO 
*** STARTED 
*** CURRENT 
*** DONE 
*** CANCELED
